ABTesting
=========

The ABTesting library is a fixed-up version of the (dufunct?) Fairly Certain library, which was a C-sharp port of the 
Ruby on Rails library A/Bingo [http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo].

ABTesting fixes a number of bugs in the Fairly Certain library, and adds support for multi-alternative tests (these are
sometimes called A/B/N or A/B/Z tests).
